1. Data Sources 
Crime data - https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/2016-Annual-Crime-Data/8iue-zpf6/data

Graduation data - https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-High-School-Graduation-Rates/xeb7-q8v3/data


2. Transformation process
- The data was somewhat cleaned already when i imported it, but some columns needed to be droppe such as, the rest of the graduation below 2016.
- set the council district as the set_index
- 

3. Database

- I chose to load my data into mysql database, since my csv files use rows and columns, just made more sense to use mysql, it made it more clean.
